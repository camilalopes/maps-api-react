# Vancouver Downtown map with good places to eat

An interactive map of Downtown Vancouver build with [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial), [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/places-api) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## Live App

You can acess the application [here](https://camilalopes.github.io/maps-api-react/)

## To run locally

1. Download or clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/camilalopes/maps-api-react.git
```
2. Inside the project directory run `npm install`

3. Start the application `npm start`

4.  With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:3000`

## Offline mode

The `creat-react-app` creates a service worker to cache, but it only works in production mode, so you need to run

```
npm run build`
```

## Important

This application uses API's from Google maps and Foursquare, and developer free plans are only limited.
